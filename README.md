## Overview

iScanner is an IOS app that can be used to scan for and advertise as an iBeacon device. iBeacon is a technology developed by Apple that allows mobile devices to detect and interact with beacons placed in the physical environment. The App is split into three tabs:

- **Receive:** Scan for nearby iBeacons.
- **Transmit:** Advertise as an iBeacon.
- **Settings**: Configure scan and advertisement parameters.

## ðŸª„ Features

- Scanning iBeacon(s): Scan for nearby iBeacons by supplying one or several UUIDs. The information of all nearby iBeacons that are comply to the supplied UUIDs are displayed in a list, including UUID, major, minor, proximity and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator).
- Advertising iBeacon: Turn your smartphone into an iBeacon. This allows other devices to scan and detect your phone as an iBeacon.
