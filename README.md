## Overview

iScanner is an IOS app that can be used to scan for and advertise as an iBeacon device. iBeacon is a technology developed by Apple that allows mobile devices to detect and interact with beacons placed in the physical environment. The App is split into three tabs:

- **Receive:** Scan for nearby iBeacons.
- **Transmit:** Advertise as an iBeacon.
- **Settings**: Configure scan and advertisement parameters.

## ðŸª„ Features

- Scanning iBeacon(s): Scan for nearby iBeacons by supplying one or several UUIDs. The information of all nearby iBeacons are displayed in a list, including UUID, major, minor, proximity and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator).
- Advertising iBeacon: Turn your smartphone into an iBeacon. This allows other devices to scan and detect your phone as an iBeacon. You can configure your iBeacon advertisiment parameters in the Settings tab.

## ðŸ’» Local Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js installation.

2. Install Ionic CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-folder
```

4. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
5. To run the app in the browser for development:
```bash
ionic serve
```
Please note that Bluetooth services are not available in a browser but only on a native ios device.

6. To run the app on a physical device or simulator:

For iOS:

```bash
ionic cap run ios
